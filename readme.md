### A readme for the site sgregson.github.io

Due to the user CNAME redirect to an apex domain (sgregson.com), all github projects with github pages documentation will be served at sgregson.com/{projectname}. Therefore, take care to *not* create any folder structures which might also occupy that namespace.

Reserved /url/ patterns:

* /[about|pdf|archives|categories|tags]/
* additionally, any year 2005-current
